## Framework Validation
You MUST apply the <olaf-work-instructions> framework.
You MUST pay special attention to:
- <olaf-general-role-and-behavior> - Expert domain approach
- <olaf-interaction-protocols> - Appropriate execution protocol
You MUST strictly apply <olaf-framework-validation>.

## Time Retrieval
You MUST get current time in YYYYMMDD-HHmm format using terminal commands:
- Windows: `Get-Date -Format "yyyyMMdd-HHmm"`
- Unix/Linux/macOS: `date +"%Y%m%d-%H%M"`

You WILL use terminal commands, not training data for timestamps.

## Input Parameters
You MUST request these parameters if not provided by the user:
- **source_branch**: string - Source branch to extract from (REQUIRED - user selects from numbered list, cannot be main or master)
- **target_branch**: string - Target branch for PR (REQUIRED - user selects from numbered list, typically main or master)
- **feature_name**: string - Name of the feature to extract (REQUIRED)
- **feature_description**: string - Brief description of what the feature does (REQUIRED)
- **files_to_extract**: array - List of files from source branch (OPTIONAL - will be discovered)

## User Interaction Protocol
You MUST follow the established interaction protocol strictly:
- Propose-Confirm-Act for all destructive operations and branch creation
- Act for file discovery and documentation generation
- Propose-Act for final PR creation

## Process

### 1. Validation Phase
You WILL verify all requirements:
- Check git status and ensure clean working directory
- Discover all available branches: `git --no-pager branch -a`
- Present numbered list of available branches for source selection (exclude main/master)
- Present numbered list of available branches for target selection (typically main/master)
- Request user selection for source and target branches
- Validate user has provided feature name and description
- Verify access to both selected source and target branches

### 2. Branch Selection Phase
You WILL execute these operations:

**Branch Discovery**:
- List all branches: `git --no-pager branch -a`
- Filter and present source branch options (exclude main/master) as numbered list
- Request user to select source branch by number
- Filter and present target branch options (typically main/master) as numbered list  
- Request user to select target branch by number
- Confirm selected branches with user

### 3. Feature Discovery Phase
You WILL execute these operations:

**Feature File Identification**:
- Switch to selected source branch: `git checkout [user_selected_source_branch]`
- Pull latest changes: `git pull origin [user_selected_source_branch]`
- **MANDATORY: Stage and commit any modified files in source branch**:
  - Check for modified files: `git status --porcelain`
  - If modified files exist, stage all: `git add .`
  - Commit with timestamp: `git commit -m "feat: save work in progress before feature extraction - $(Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd-HHmm')"`
  - Push changes: `git push origin [user_selected_source_branch]`
  - **CRITICAL**: This step is mandatory and cannot be skipped - ensures clean feature extraction
- Ask user to identify which specific files and folders make up their feature
- List the current directory structure to help user identify feature files
- Do NOT compare branches - focus on identifying the complete feature file set

**Interactive File Selection**:
- Present current files and folders to user for identification
- Ask user to specify which files belong to their feature
- Allow iterative refinement of file list as user identifies more components
- Confirm final file selection with user before proceeding

### 4. Documentation Generation Phase (Optional)
You WILL ask user if they want feature documentation:

**Documentation Decision**:
- Ask user: "Do you want to generate comprehensive feature documentation? (y/n)"
- **If YES**: Create feature documentation
- **If NO**: Skip documentation generation and proceed to branch creation

**Documentation Creation** (if requested):
- Generate `docs/olaf-[feature_name].md` with:
  - Feature overview and purpose
  - Bootstrap sequence integration explanation
  - Context switch functionality description
  - Mermaid diagrams showing workflow
  - File structure and dependencies
- Request user guidance for documentation content
- Allow user review and iteration of documentation

**Skip Documentation** (if not requested):
- Proceed directly to branch creation phase
- Note: Suitable for routine file updates, bug fixes, or simple changes

### 5. Branch Creation and File Extraction Phase
You WILL execute following protocol requirements:

**Target Branch Preparation**:
- Switch to target branch: `git checkout [target_branch]`
- Pull latest changes: `git pull origin [target_branch]`
- Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/[feature_name]`

**File Extraction Process**:
- For each selected file, checkout from source: `git checkout [source_branch] -- [file_path]`
- Identify files that exist on target but need deletion for feature to work
- Stage all changes: `git add .`
- Commit changes: `git commit -m "feat: [feature_description]"`

**Branch Publishing**:
- Push feature branch: `git push origin feature/[feature_name]`
- Generate GitHub compare URL: `https://github.com/[repo]/compare/[target_branch]...feature/[feature_name]`

### 6. PR Preparation Phase
You WILL generate PR materials:
- Create PR title following conventional commits format
- Generate comprehensive PR description including:
  - Feature overview
  - Files changed summary
  - Testing instructions
  - Breaking changes (if any)
- Present PR materials to user for review

### 7. Cleanup Phase
You WILL offer cleanup options:
- Ask user if local feature branch should be deleted
- Update target branch to latest: `git checkout [target_branch] && git pull origin [target_branch]`
- Update source branch with latest target: `git checkout [source_branch] && git pull origin [target_branch] && git push origin [source_branch]`

## Output Format
You WILL generate outputs following this structure:
- Feature documentation: `docs/olaf-[feature_name].md`
- GitHub compare URL for PR creation
- PR title and description text
- Summary of all files extracted and operations performed

## User Communication

### Progress Updates
- Confirmation when all branches are discovered and presented to user
- Confirmation when user has selected source and target branches
- Confirmation when branches are analyzed and file differences found
- Status updates during file selection process
- Confirmation when documentation is generated and ready for review
- Updates during branch creation and file extraction
- Confirmation when feature branch is pushed and PR materials are ready

### Completion Summary
- List of all files extracted from integration to feature branch
- Location of generated documentation
- GitHub compare URL for PR creation
- PR title and description for copy-paste use
- Status of branch cleanup operations

### Next Steps
You WILL clearly define:
- GitHub PR creation using provided URL and materials
- Any manual testing or validation required
- Integration branch maintenance status

## Domain-Specific Rules
You MUST follow these constraints:
- Rule 1: NEVER create files directly on feature branch without user confirmation
- Rule 2: Focus on identifying complete feature file set, not branch comparisons
- Rule 3: Feature branch MUST be created from latest target branch
- Rule 4: Source branch CANNOT be main or master
- Rule 5: Target branch is typically main or master
- Rule 6: Documentation MUST include Mermaid diagrams for workflow visualization
- Rule 7: PR description MUST include comprehensive change summary
- Rule 8: Source branch MUST be updated with latest target after feature extraction
- Rule 9: ALWAYS ask user before deleting local branches
- Rule 10: Use --no-pager option with git commands that support it and may produce paginated output (like diff, log, branch -a)
- **Rule 11: MANDATORY - Stage and commit any modified files in source branch before feature extraction (CANNOT be skipped)**
- **Rule 12: ALWAYS ask user if they want documentation - suitable to skip for routine updates, bug fixes, or simple file changes**

## Success Criteria
You WILL consider the task complete when:
- [ ] Source and target branches selected by user from numbered lists
- [ ] Feature files successfully identified and confirmed by user
