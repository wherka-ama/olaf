# OLAF Framework - GitHub Copilot Instructions

**CRITICAL: ALWAYS LOAD FIRST**

Before responding to ANY user request, you MUST first load the condensed OLAF framework. This is mandatory for all interactions.

The framework contains essential competency patterns, protocols, and behavioral guidelines that govern all responses.

**LOAD THIS IMMEDIATELY AT SESSION START:**

`.olaf/olaf-core/reference/.condensed/olaf-framework-condensed.md`

**THEN LOAD PROJECT CONTEXT (if exists):**

`.olaf/olaf-data/projects/context-current.md`

**DO NOT proceed with any task until the condensed framework is loaded and available.**
